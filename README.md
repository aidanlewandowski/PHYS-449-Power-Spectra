# PHYS-449-Power-Spectra

Hello! My name is Aidan and I am in my final semester as a Physics Undergraduate at McGill University! This is my semester research project at the Trottier Space Institute, with a focus on Power Spectra and 21 cm Cosmology. The "Power Spectra Intro" file contains the breakdown of each step of generating the 2D power spectrum line for a small test case. The "2D Power Spectrum Function" file contains the code used to turn the series of smaller functions into a larger generate_pk_2D function. The "Experiment" file was an additional file used to debug the generate_pk_2D function. The "3D Power Spectrum Function" contains the code for the generate_pk_3D function, as well as the beginning of the 21cmFAST data implementation. The "Polished Version" file contains the cleaned-up version of implementing the 21cmFAST data, and contains the majority of the plots used in my final report.
